Top N Products React App

This React application fetches product data from an API and displays the top N products based on user selections.

Features:

API Integration: Connects to a backend API (replace with specific API details) to retrieve product information.
Filtering: Allows users to filter products by company, category, price range, and top N value.
Sorting (Optional): Provides options to sort products by various criteria (e.g., price, rating).
Pagination (Optional): Handles large datasets by displaying products in manageable chunks (consider server-side pagination if supported by the API).
Modern Frontend: Leverages React and a CSS library (e.g., Material UI, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) for a clean and responsive user interface.
